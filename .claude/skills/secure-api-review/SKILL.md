  generating an OpenAPI spec.

# Secure API review

When you create or change an API endpoint:
1. Authentication: every endpoint requires the gateway JWT;
   no anonymous routes outside /health.
2. Input validation: validate request bodies against the OpenAPI
   schema and reject unknown fields.
3. Audit: every state-changing endpoint emits an audit event with
   actor, action, entity and timestamp.
4. Data classification: fields tagged pii in the schema must never
   appear in logs or error messages.

Run scripts/check-endpoints.sh and include its output in your summary.
